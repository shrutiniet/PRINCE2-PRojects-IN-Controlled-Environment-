# PRINCE2-PRojects-IN-Controlled-Environment-

1. PRINCE2 stands for PRojects In Controlled Environment. It is among the best and most recognized project management approaches derived from its predecessor, PRINCE.
2. Any project and environment can quickly adapt PRINCE 2 as its project management strategy. The project management strategy has been successfully adopted in more than 50 countries. It is designed such that it can prove to be beneficial for both the public and private sectors.
3. Those project managers who use PRINCE2 as their project management strategy/ must identify whether the task is a project or it is business as usual.


**How does PRINCE2 Define Project?**
According to PRINCE2, a project is a temporary organization that consists of a group of people known as the project management team. This project management team is responsible to execute and complete the project within the defined duration. As per PRINCE2's methodology, it is crucial for every member of the project management team to be able to define and justify what they are doing to complete the project. 
**According to PRINCE2, a project is:** "a temporary organization that is created for the purpose of delivering one or more business products according to an agreed business case.‚Äù

**Elements Separating Project from Regular Business:**
1. **CHANGE**: A project brings out a change within an organization. For example, if an organization works on a project concerning the implementation of AI to filter out suitable candidates, then there will be a change in the functioning of this organization's HR department.
2. **TEMPORARY:** A project brings out a change within an organization. For example, if an organization works on a project concerning the implementation of AI to filter out suitable candidates, then there will be a change in the functioning of this organization's HR department.
3. **CROSS-FUNCTIONAL:** An ideal project must be cross-functional, i.e. it must have representatives with diverse skill sets. They should also belong to different departments of the organization. Sometimes, these representatives are even selected from different organizations.
 Although this diversity of perspectives and skills must be well-appreciated, there must be an alignment amongst these perspectives. Otherwise, the project's completion speed will slow down and even risk failure.
4. **UNIQUE:** A project must always have some extent of uniqueness in it. This uniqueness can range anywhere from the project of sending the first human being into the space to the installation of new software in your office. Now, although you might have seen the installation of software programs earlier as well, this project can be a little different as can involve new people and bring out change in your organization.
5. **UNCERTAINTY:** The last four characteristics induce a lot of uncertainty into a project, and nobody in the organization can project how things will turn out. Compared to regular business practices or business, there can be a lot of unforeseen circumstances and risks involved in a project. Therefore, uncertainty is one of the important elements of a project.

_**THE CONFIGURATION OF PRINCE2**_
PRINCE2 is a project management method that focuses on completing projects by dividing them into various controllable and manageable stages. The basic configuration of PRINCE2 methodology can be divided into the following components:
1. The seven principles of PRINCE2:  They explain the guidelines to be followed in PRINCE2.
2. The seven themes: Describe the tools to be used in the project.
3. The seven processes: They provide details for the PRINCE2 journey, from its beginning to its end.

   Aside from these components, management products are also an important component of the PRINCE2 methodology. There are around 26 management products in PRINCE2, and they are divided into the following three parts:
**Baselines**
**Records**
**Reports**

**THE SEVEN PRINCIPLES OF PRINCE2**
A project not corresponding to these principles is said to be not being managed by the PRINCE2 methodology. these seven principles are:
**Continued Business Justification:** During any project, the Business Case serves as the most crucial document. It is required to be updated at every stage of the project to ensure project viability. A project that does not update its business case regularly can get terminated in the early stages.
**Learn from experience:** This PRINCE2 principle ensures that each project maintains its lessons log. All projects must keep referring to their own lesson logs and those of their previous projects to avoid any mishaps. Unless these lessons initiate a change, they are determined as lessons identified and not as lessons learned.
**Defined roles and responsibilities:** In every project, team members are assigned different roles. Each individual team member can either share a role or take on multiple roles simultaneously. There is a four-structured hierarchy of roles in PRINCE2. These are:

(1) Corporate or program management.
(2) Project board.
(3) Project manager level.
(4) Team level.

**Management Products of PRINCE2**
**Some important examples of management products from the PRINC2 method are:**
The Benefits Management Approach: It defines the method and time for measuring the project's benefits expected by the senior user.
Business Case: It captures financial justification for a project. It works as per the PRINCE2 principle that a project must display continued business justification. According to PRINCE2, if the Business Case becomes non-sensical, the project must either be changed or stopped.
Checkpoint Report: This report is created by the Team Manager and sent to the Project Manager regularly to report the status of the Work Package.
Communications Management Approach: It describes methods and frequencies of communicating with stakeholders while covering the information flow to and from the stakeholders.
Daily Log: It records informal issues.
Issues Register: It consists of notes regarding change requests, complaints, and problems sent by the project members.
Lessons Log: It contains the lessons learned that could be useful in future projects.

**AGILE**
Agile is basically an iterative approach that is used in project management and software development. After combining with PRINCE2, Agile becomes PRINCE2-Agile. This dual framework for project management was released back in 2015 and since then, has been extremely popular.

**The Kanban System**

The origins of the Kanban system traced back to the 1940s when it was developed by Toyota to improve manufacturing efficiency. The scope of Kanban is larger in the sense that it allows team members to step out of their roles and use their expertise to help those in need. **The Kanban method works on the following six rules:**
**1. Visualizing the Work:** When team members visualize their work, they are able to get a better sense of the project.
**2. Limiting the Work-in-Progress (WIP):** Since switching between tasks is time-consuming, the Kanban system focuses on WIP. This ensures that people only accept doing work when they are capable to do so.
**3. Flow Management:** After reaching the WIP limit, a bottleneck is created. This is when others in the Kanban system hustle together to get rid of this bottleneck, even if they lack the necessary expertise.
**4. Clear Policies:** Kanban focuses on creating limits on WIP early in the project. At the same time, it proposes solutions to solve these bottlenecks to save time. 
**5. Feedback Loop Implementation:** Daily meetings and collaboration with customers is an integral part of the Kanban policy as this helps in getting valuable feedback.
**6. Collaborative Improvement with Experimental Evolution:** The Kanban method emphasizes identifying the bottlenecks and improving them once they are identified. Also, taking a proactive approach, such as the PDCA cycle, can be helpful in preventing such bottlenecks in the future.
