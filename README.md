2. Any project and environment can quickly adapt PRINCE 2 as its project management strategy. The project management strategy has been successfully adopted in more than 50 countries. It is designed such that it can prove to be beneficial for both the public and private sectors.
3. Those project managers who use PRINCE2 as their project management strategy/ must identify whether the task is a project or it is business as usual.


**How does PRINCE2 Define Project?**
According to PRINCE2, a project is a temporary organization that consists of a group of people known as the project management team. This project management team is responsible to execute and complete the project within the defined duration. As per PRINCE2's methodology, it is crucial for every member of the project management team to be able to define and justify what they are doing to complete the project. 
**According to PRINCE2, a project is:** "a temporary organization that is created for the purpose of delivering one or more business products according to an agreed business case.‚Äù

**Elements Separating Project from Regular Business:**
1. **CHANGE**: A project brings out a change within an organization. For example, if an organization works on a project concerning the implementation of AI to filter out suitable candidates, then there will be a change in the functioning of this organization's HR department.
2. **TEMPORARY:** A project brings out a change within an organization. For example, if an organization works on a project concerning the implementation of AI to filter out suitable candidates, then there will be a change in the functioning of this organization's HR department.
3. **CROSS-FUNCTIONAL:** An ideal project must be cross-functional, i.e. it must have representatives with diverse skill sets. They should also belong to different departments of the organization. Sometimes, these representatives are even selected from different organizations.
 Although this diversity of perspectives and skills must be well-appreciated, there must be an alignment amongst these perspectives. Otherwise, the project's completion speed will slow down and even risk failure.
4. **UNIQUE:** A project must always have some extent of uniqueness in it. This uniqueness can range anywhere from the project of sending the first human being into the space to the installation of new software in your office. Now, although you might have seen the installation of software programs earlier as well, this project can be a little different as can involve new people and bring out change in your organization.
5. **UNCERTAINTY:** The last four characteristics induce a lot of uncertainty into a project, and nobody in the organization can project how things will turn out. Compared to regular business practices or business, there can be a lot of unforeseen circumstances and risks involved in a project. Therefore, uncertainty is one of the important elements of a project.
